This game is a space-themed fitness game. Your mission as a player is to help an astronaut safely get back home to Earth. Walk to stations and complete puzzles to send a signal and get valuable resources. Donâ€™t get lazy! Only you can help your stranded astronaut! You will need to move your character to different places by walking in real life. Explore various challenging routes, get your strength level back up, and finally get back home safely.  

  

This game integrates with the #Walk15 app, providing an interactive space-walking experience and gamifying leisure walking. In the game, you can choose from a wide range of different level routes, each encompassing tougher puzzles and longer distances. The player will be then redirected to the #Walk15 app, where they will be given instructions on where to start and how to complete the chosen route. Upon reaching specific route checkpoints our game notification will pop-up, instructing the user to solve a puzzle before continuing to the next checkpoint. After completing all checkpoints and finishing the route, the player will be redirected back to our game and receive rewards. These can further be used to upgrade our character and equip them with the tools needed for the next mission.  

  

The game offers a user-friendly walking and puzzle-solving experience while encouraging real-life fitness. If you want to get fit and be entertained at the same time then this game is for you.
